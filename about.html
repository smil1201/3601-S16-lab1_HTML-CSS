    <figcaption class="rightAlignedCaption"> My name is Jerry. I sell food. This is not the contact info you are looking for.
        I was born in Russia in 1975 to a butcher and a taylor. At the ripe age of seven I smoked my pipe, and established myself as the rightful owner of Jerry's foods in Moscow.
    After being thrown out for my capitalist approach, I moved to the United States and have since rekindled my love for selling groceries.
        I have since dedicated my life to finding the best quality locally-grown foods that money can buy, and the cabbage man has worked with me to do just that. </figcaption>
